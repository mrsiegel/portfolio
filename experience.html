<h1>WORK EXPERIENCES</h1>

<h2>Humanizing at Work Research</h2>
<h3>Center for Positive Organizations Research Assistant</h3>
<p>I investigated how people come to see their colleagues and themselves as human beings beyond their work positions and titles. I did this through coding qualitative data from interviews regarding the connection between colleagues at work after interacting with one another in a program outside of work. I was able to use my extensive training in Positive Organizational Scholarship to help with my analysis.</p>

<h2>BestFoodFeed</h2>
<h3>Business Analyst</h3>
<p>I analyzed the effectiveness and efficiency of newly created data platforms and dashboards through my use of data collection tools. I became proficient in Excel in doing so. I collected data regarding customer retention and customer acquisition in order to develop a growth plan. I determined and presented to the team the products and features that should be implemented into future dashboards. In addition, I wrote the markdown documentation for the new user platform.</p>

<h2>Women’s Participation on Wikipedia Research</h2>
<h3>Research Assistant</h3>
<p>I assessed what motivates experts to contribute to public information goods such as Wikipedia through my knowledge of online platforms. I analyzed the underrepresentation of women, specifically economists, on Wikipedia by creating Wikipedia pages for women economists and evaluating how Wikipedia edits these pages in relation to pages for men economists.</p>

<h2>SOAR! United</h2>
<h3>Welcome Center & Head of Social Media/Marketing</h3>
<p>I generated new and improved business Instagram and Facebook accounts and formed a marketing group. This marketing group helped with social media and advertising around the Dallas area. I introduced and implemented SOAR! Summer Camp, which generating over $5,000 of incremental revenue in one session.</p>
