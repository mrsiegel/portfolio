<h2>SI106 Programs, Information and People</h2>
<p>This course is an introduction to programming with a focus on applications in informatics. It covers the fundamental elements of a modern programming language and how to access data on the internet. Focuses on exploring how humans and technology complement one another, including techniques used to coordinate groups of people working together on software development.</p>

<h2>SI110 Introduction to Information Studies</h2>
<p>This course provides the foundational knowledge necessary to begin to address the key issues associated with the Information Revolution. The issues covered range from the theoretical (what is information and how do humans construct it?), to the cultural (is life on the screen a qualitatively different phenomenon from experiences with earlier distance-shrinking and knowledge-building technologies such as telephones?), to the practical (what is the basic architecture of computing networks?). This course gives you the conceptual tools for an initial understanding of the politics, economics, and culture of the Information Age.</p>

<h2>SI206 Data-Oriented Programming</h2>
<p>This course develops core programming and software development skills, to build competency and literacy in important areas that includes basic data structures, debugging and testing, using distributed code repositories, pattern matching, and programmatic gathering and processing of data.</p>

<h2>STATS250 Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis</h2>
<p>This course covers applied statistical methodology from an analysis-of-data viewpoint. The course focuses on frequency distributions, measures of location, mean, median, mode, measures of dispersion, variance, graphic presentation, elementary probability, populations and samples, sampling distributions, one sample univariate inference problems, and two sample problems, categorical data, regression and correlation, and analysis of variance. R Commander is utilized in this course as well.</p>

<h2>SI301 Models of Social Information Processing</h2>
<p>This course focuses on how social groups form, interact, and change. Some of the topics include technical structures of social networks and exploring how individual actions are combined to produce collective effects. The techniques learned in this course can be applied to understanding friend systems like Facebook, recommender systems such as Digg, auction systems such as Ebay, and information webs used by search engines such as Google. This course introduces two conceptual models, networks and games, for how information flows and is used in multi-person settings. Networks or graph representations describe the structure of connections among people and documents. They permit mathematical analysis and meaningful visualizations that highlight different roles played by different people or documents, as well as features of the collection as a whole. Game representations describe, in situations of interdependence, the actions available to different people and how each person's outcomes are contingent on the choices of other people. It permits analysis of stable sets of choices by all the people (equilibrium's). It also provides a framework for analysis of the likely effects of alternative designs for markets and information elicitation mechanisms, based on their abstract game representations.</p> 

<h2>SI310 Information Environments and Work</h2>
<p>This course looks at information's role in organizations, including psychological, economic, management and sociocultural perspectives. It explores sense-making and effective communication, including the importance of "story-telling." It covers key humanistic perspectives and ethical issues related to information. Also this course goes into the nature of requirements.</p>

<h2>SI339 Web Design, Development, and Accessibility</h2>
<p>This course provides a hands-on approach to learning responsive, accessible front-end programming for Web Design. Topics covered include HTML5, CSS3 (including Bootstrap framework), JavaScript, and the POUR design principles of accessible design.</p>

<h2>SI410 Ethics and Information Technology</h2>
<p>This course applies an emergent philosophy of information to a variety of new technologies that are inherently social in their design, construction, and use. The course focuses on social media interaction, remembering/forgetting, and game design ethics. By collaborating on building a wiki community, students explore ethical/unethical information behaviors and test information quality metrics.</p>
