<p>Welcome! My name is Margot Siegel and I am a junior at the University of Michigan School of Information. The School of Information program is inspired by the traditions of a liberal education, blended with a technical lens, skills, and knowledge. I am studying Information Analysis and Entrepreneurship. I want to use my skills to create tailored solutions for stakeholders in both business and innovation. I am hoping to bridge the gap between humans, innovation, and business technology. </p>

<p>I am from Dallas, Texas, but I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan during the school year. I love to travel and try new restaurants. I can tell you all the best restaurants in Dallas and Ann Arbor. </p>

<p>I am involved in several clubs on campus. I am in a tech consulting group called Reach Consulting Group where I am working on a data analytics project. I am also a lead fellow for +LAB, an organization through the Center for Positive Organizations at the Ross School of Business. As a lead fellow I am continuing my education on the science behind Positive Organizational Scholarship. I am co-founder of a club called Runway of Dreams that puts on a fashion show to promote adaptive clothing for children with disabilities.</p>
